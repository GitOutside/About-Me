    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
     <p>I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. I grew up in the PNW and in Madrid, Spain. I still remember some Spanish, and have always liked learning other languages. Perhaps that's why I like coding.
      <br/><br/>I live with my pup Rudie - a fine labradoodle. My son is grown, and lives on his own now.
      <br/><br/>I love to be outside and being active, especially climbing, backpacking and cycling. I also dabble in silvesmithing, to make jewelry.
